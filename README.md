# Chip8-Interpret
Simple chip8 interpreter using imgui for GUI, written in C.

Basic usage:

Run
```make build``` in the project root directory.

The file "Chip8-Interpret.out" will be created in the ./build directory.

To load and run a program, run
```./build/Chip8-Interpret.out <program file>.ch8```

Programs can also be reloaded or loaded using the UI, which can be accessed by pressing the ESC key while a program is running.

Currently only tested on Linux. Should in theory be portable to windows, but might require some work to compile properly.

Super-Chip functionality is currently not supported.
